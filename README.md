# pong-rs

Classic **Pong** game implementation made with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language and the [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) game engine. This project derived from the pong example found in the [Amethyst book](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/pong-tutorial.html) and features some more advanced features, such as [configuration files](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/appendices/a_config_files.html), [Assets](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/assets.html) and [Prefabs](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/prefabs.html), multiple [States](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/concepts/state.html) and State transitions, a fully working menu with selectable items and control over [System](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/concepts/system.html) execution (e.g. State-specific [Dispatchers](https://amethyst.rs/book/master/concepts/dispatcher.html) and pausable systems.).

This project was mostly used to get a better grasp of the programming language while gaining some experience with the game engine.
